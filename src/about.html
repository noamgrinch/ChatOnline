<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Server-Client chat program</h1>

<p>This is a small server-client program I have made.<br>
The program is divided into a several packages and sub-packages. Here is a small explanatin:
</p>


<h3>CentralLogger package</h3>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
The Central Logger package contains the logger server in it. Nothing speical, just some formatting and stuff.
It implements the Runnable interface so it can be ran alognside the main server.
</p>


<h3>Client package</h3>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
The client package contains the main client program (Client.java) which launches a new client.
It also contains all of the relevant flows that the client needs from the server.
</p>

<h3>GUI package</h3>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
The GUI package contains all of the GUI proccesses in it. including the interactive panels for each flow and communicating to the server if needed.
sub-packages:
ChatFrame: a frame which presents the active chat with a user.
Friends: the friends list and main GUI for the program(if it's closed, the application is closed).
FriendsRequest: handles the friends requests window.
Login: handles the login window.
Registration: handles the registration window.
</p>


<h3>Server package</h3>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
The Server package contains the main Runnable server. It hold all of the data(NOT connected to a DB machine).
All of the relevant flows from the users are coded into integers. You can see it int ClientThread.java.
the server is multi-threaed and safe(synchronized).
</p>


<h3>SpringUtilities</h3>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
An external library for the registration panel.
</p>


<h3>Util package</h3>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">
The Util package conatins the data that should be in both client and server programs.
Data structures as User and Chat that are universal.
